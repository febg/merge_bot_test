#  CoverageAnalyzer

## What It Does
Analyzes test coverage in the form of JSON produced from a `.xccovreport` contained in a `.xcresult` build artifact.
Prints results and writes them to a .json file for upstream consumption.

Initially, requires the user (or another script) to extract the JSON. See the "How it Works" section below for more details.

When working with a single coverage report, prints test coverage percentages for each build target in the report, and writes the results to disk as a JSON string.  For each target, includes coverage percentage and a weight percentage comparing lines of code in this target against the project as a whole.

When working with two coverage reports, produces a diff (expressed as +/-%) by comparing per-target coverage percentages from each report, prints them, and writes the results to disk as a JSON string.

## How It Works
When `xcodebuild` builds & runs tests, the output is collected in a `.xcresult` file alongside project build artifacts 

ex. `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/slack-bcuxvvvtdclvllgvjebneduwvxvq/Logs/Test/Test-iOS - Prod-2019.05.11_10-43-31--0700.xcresult`

This file contains coverage data that can be extracted as JSON data via `xcrun xccov`
ex.  `xcrun xccov view testResult.xcresult/1_Test/action.xccovreport --json`

Initially, this tool isn't capable of shelling out itself to extract the JSON coverage, so you'll need do that via another method. Pass the resulting JSON as arguments to this tool.

## How to Use It

**Find the build directory where code action.xccovreport file was generated**

It is usually under
```
  ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/slack-*/Logs/Test/BUILD.xcresult/1_Test/action.xccovreport 
 ```

 **Use Xcode command line tools to extract a JSON representation of action.xccovreport file**

 ```
 xcrun xccov view testResult.xcresult/1_Test/action.xccovreport --json > test_coverage_raw_1.json
 ```

**Edit config file**
(Examples section shows the usage of different commands )

- coverage_analyzer.json 
```
{
  "command": "",
  "reportFiles": [""],
  "pullFiles": [""]
}
```
**Run CoverageAnalyzer by passing the config file path as argument**

 `./CoverageAnalyzer coverage_analyzer.json`


## Examples
### **File-level coverage report for ALL files**

A code coverage report applied to all files in project con be computed using the following config


- Command `command`: String command to analyze all files
- Parameter `reportFiles`: Array containing path to raw JSON coverage report  
- Paramater `pullFiles`: Empty - Not needed since all files are being analyzed

Example config:

**coverage_analyzer.json**

```
{
	"command":"analyze-all",
	"reportFiles": ["test_coverage_raw_1.json"],
	"pullFiles":[]
}
```
Example run: 

`./CoverageAnalyzer coverage_analyzer.json`

### **Difference between two code coverage reports**

Differenece between any two code coverage reports con be computed using the following config

- Command `command`: String command to analyze a set of files
- Parameter `reportFiles`: Array containing **two** raw JSON coverage report paths (paths to files being analyzed) 
- Paramater `pullFiles`: Empty - Not needed since all files are being analyzed

Example config:

**coverage_analyzer.json**

```
{
	"command":"analyze-diff",
	"reportFiles": ["test_coverage_raw_1.json", "test_coverage_raw_2.json"],
	"pullFiles":[]

## Testing

**Testing can be done in two ways**
- Using Xcode 
```
Product -> Test (or using âŒ˜U shortcut)
```

- Using Xcode command line
From root directory
```
xcodebuild -project CoverageAnalyzer.xcodeproj/ -scheme CoverageAnalyzer test
```

## TODO

- Add line coverage functionality
- Add file / line coverage results to summary 
- Re-factor Analyzer.analyze() method to encode JSON from a string 
- Add tests to re-factored version of Analyzer.analyze()
